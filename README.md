Learning GitHub
looks a bit weired...am just folowing instructions without knowing what am doing
anyway  i have to learn this...and am commited to show results after learning Github
what make me so sure?  its because i have been accepted today to start a class learning coding...
consider it as new start in learning new things as am a biologist
wishing all the best for myself and for this change in direction
